My personal sticker app for the WA Messenger with Penguin Stickers. 
The [official WhatsApp template](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers) is modified, adding additional buttons to open Telegram or Signal sticker pack links. The links for this are provided through the contents.json just like the WA Messenger Sticker data, making for a clean solution.


[Install it from the Play Store][play-store-link]
